Comparative Analysis of Two Anomaly Detection Models (DBSCAN and Z-Score) for Detecting Suspicious Transactions in a Bank's Client Dataset: A Python-Based Approach
In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis to compare the effectiveness of two popular anomaly detection models—DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) and Z-Score—using a substantial dataset of 10 million transaction records from bank clients. The primary goal was to identify potentially fraudulent activities within the dataset and provide financial institutions with more effective tools for detecting and preventing suspicious transactions.

Project Highlights:
Dataset Analysis:

Utilized Python to manage and analyze a massive dataset of 10 million transaction records.
Preprocessed the data to handle missing values, normalize features, and prepare it for anomaly detection.
Model Implementation:

Implemented the DBSCAN algorithm to identify clusters of normal transactions and isolate outliers as potential anomalies.
Applied the Z-Score method to statistically identify transactions that deviate significantly from the norm.
Comparative Insights:

Conducted a detailed comparison of the strengths and weaknesses of DBSCAN and Z-Score in the context of anomaly detection.
Evaluated model performance based on metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.
Impactful Findings:

Revealed valuable insights into which model is more effective under different circumstances and datasets.
Provided actionable recommendations for financial institutions to enhance their fraud detection systems.
